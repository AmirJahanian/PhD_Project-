# PhD_Project-
The PhD project was on: Extending the body in augmented reality: Behavioral and neural correlates of body schema during virtual tool-use training in young and older adults. This project is part of a DFG funded research titled "Plasticity of minimal self in healthy aging: how virtual & real-life changes in sensorimotor experiences shape perception of body ownership, agency and location". In my dissertation three studies were presented investigating the effect of virtual tool-use training as a motor sequential learning task on the alteration of body schema and body image and reported that changes in agency is dependent to either practice effect in older adults or emerged independently in younger adults during the task. Additionally, ownership ratings were associated with changes in body schema and practice effect during the training. Interestingly esting-state relative beta power and task-related relative theta, alpha and beta power predicted stronger practice effect (Learning) in younger adults compared to older adults where higher resting state relative alpha power predicted practice effect.
