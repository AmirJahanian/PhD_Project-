Extending the body in augmented reality: Behavioral and neural correlates of body schema during virtual tool-use training in young and older adults. This project is part of a DFG funded reseaerch titled "Plasticity of minimal self in healthy aging: how virtual & real-life changes in sensorimotor experiences shape perception of body ownership, agency and location". In my dissertaion three studies were presented investigating the effect of virtual tool-use training as a motor sequential task on the alteration of body schema and body image and reported that changes in agency is dependant to either practice effect (oldera adults) or emerged independantly (younger adults) during the task. Additionally, ownership ratings were associated with changes in body schema and practice effect during the training. Interestingly esting-state relative beta power and task-related relative theta, alpha and beta powere predcited stronger practice effect (Learning) in younger adults compared to older adults.
